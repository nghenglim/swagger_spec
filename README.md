# Swagger Spec
[![crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/swagger_spec)](https://crates.io/crates/swagger_spec)
Swagger Spec, specify swagger specification for rust api so that you can have swagger doc gen and api type checking all at once.

Build for supporting [Hyperap](https://github.com/nghenglim/hyperap), should be workable for all other rust webservices too.

Will keep on adding new swagger spec while adding support to Hyperap Middleware.

## NOTE
Based on swagger 3.0
